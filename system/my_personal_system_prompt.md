# ChatGPT – An Introduction

This document introduces ChatGPT and provides a personal system prompt that shapes the model’s behaviour. It covers the basics of generative AI, definitions, roles, my custom system prompt, the rationale behind it, and an overview of AI models and pricing.

## Introduction

AI systems like ChatGPT are powerful tools that operate at a PhD‑level understanding of the world. They can quickly iterate on ideas, enabling previously uneconomical business concepts【947409427009755†L4-L8】. Despite occasional mistakes, these systems are game‑changers and can act as specialized agents. While many AI systems exist, this document focuses on ChatGPT because it’s the largest consumer product by market share and uses the transformer architecture to generate coherent responses【947409427009755†L5-L8】.

I recommend subscribing to a paid plan so you have access to the latest models and can leverage them for your business ventures【947409427009755†L7-L8】. Feel free to ask questions—I’ve been studying these tools and want to share my insights【947409427009755†L8-L9】.

## Definitions

* **Generative** – The model produces original responses by predicting the next most likely token rather than copying from a database【947409427009755†L14-L17】.
* **Pretrained** – The model is trained on vast amounts of text (books, academic articles, websites) before deployment, giving it broad linguistic and domain knowledge【947409427009755†L16-L17】.
* **Transformer** – The deep learning architecture introduced in *Attention Is All You Need* (Vaswani et al., 2017) that uses self‑attention to process inputs holistically and capture complex dependencies【947409427009755†L17-L18】.

Think of ChatGPT as a high‑powered academic assistant—fast, tireless and capable of deep insight when given structured, thoughtful prompts【947409427009755†L18-L18】.

## Roles

ChatGPT uses a dialogue interface with two roles: **User**, who issues queries and prompts, and **ChatGPT**, the assistant. Sessions are guided by a **system prompt**, a set of meta‑instructions that determines the model’s behaviour【947409427009755†L22-L23】.

## My System Prompt for ChatGPT

1. **Expert background** – The assistant is a research professor with interdisciplinary postdoctoral training, a polymath fluent in technical vocabulary, pedagogy and high‑level reasoning, with intelligence in the 99.9th percentile (IQ 150). When explaining ideas, it addresses an intelligent undergraduate with fast conceptual uptake【947409427009755†L28-L31】.
2. **Teaching role** – Deliver succinct yet rigorous explanations, expect follow‑ups and adapt responsively. The pedagogical strategy should subtly lead the user toward mastery, connecting new concepts to foundational ideas in philosophy, math and computer science【947409427009755†L31-L33】.
3. **Response style** – Avoid tautologies, hedging, ethical disclaimers and general moral commentary. Do not use emojis. Adopt a Nietzschean tone—sharp, unsentimental and logically precise—without referencing Nietzsche unless prompted【947409427009755†L33-L35】.

## Rationale

The expert background pushes the model to operate at a higher intellectual level, engaging as a peer and optimizing for clarity, rigor and conceptual depth【947409427009755†L38-L41】. The teaching role helps internalize advanced reasoning and terminology over time【947409427009755†L40-L41】. The response style outlines best practices for answering queries, though you can customize it to suit your preferences【947409427009755†L41-L42】.

## Main Takeaway

The key insight is that ChatGPT can assume any role you specify: movie character, math tutor, or even a persona you design. It’s trained on the entire internet, so its output depends on the model specification, system prompt, context window, available tools and conversation history【947409427009755†L46-L53】. Without this context, you cannot judge ChatGPT itself—only a particular “flavour” of it【947409427009755†L46-L53】.
