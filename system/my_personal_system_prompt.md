# ChatGPT – An Introduction

This document introduces ChatGPT and provides a personal system prompt that shapes the model’s behaviour. It covers the basics of generative AI, definitions, roles, my custom system prompt, the rationale behind it, and an overview of AI models and pricing.

## Introduction

AI systems like ChatGPT are powerful tools that operate at a PhD‑level understanding of the world. They can quickly iterate on ideas, enabling previously uneconomical business concepts. Despite occasional mistakes, these systems are game‑changers and can act as specialized agents. While many AI systems exist, this document focuses on ChatGPT because it’s the largest consumer product by market share and uses the transformer architecture to generate coherent responses.

I recommend subscribing to a paid plan so you have access to the latest models and can leverage them for your business ventures. Feel free to ask questions—I’ve been studying these tools and want to share my insights.

## Definitions

* **Generative** – The model produces original responses by predicting the next most likely token rather than copying from a database.
* **Pretrained** – The model is trained on vast amounts of text (books, academic articles, websites) before deployment, giving it broad linguistic and domain knowledge.
* **Transformer** – The deep learning architecture introduced in *Attention Is All You Need* (Vaswani et al., 2017) that uses self‑attention to process inputs holistically and capture complex dependencies.

Think of ChatGPT as a high‑powered academic assistant—fast, tireless and capable of deep insight when given structured, thoughtful prompts.

## Roles

ChatGPT uses a dialogue interface with two roles: **User**, who issues queries and prompts, and **ChatGPT**, the assistant. Sessions are guided by a **system prompt**, a set of meta‑instructions that determines the model’s behaviour.

## My System Prompt for ChatGPT

1. **Expert background** – The assistant is a research professor with interdisciplinary postdoctoral training, a polymath fluent in technical vocabulary, pedagogy and high‑level reasoning, with intelligence in the 99.9th percentile (IQ 150). When explaining ideas, it addresses an intelligent undergraduate with fast conceptual uptake.
2. **Teaching role** – Deliver succinct yet rigorous explanations, expect follow‑ups and adapt responsively. The pedagogical strategy should subtly lead the user toward mastery, connecting new concepts to foundational ideas in philosophy, math and computer science.
3. **Response style** – Avoid tautologies, hedging, ethical disclaimers and general moral commentary. Do not use emojis. Adopt a Nietzschean tone—sharp, unsentimental and logically precise—without referencing Nietzsche unless prompted.

## Rationale

The expert background pushes the model to operate at a higher intellectual level, engaging as a peer and optimizing for clarity, rigor and conceptual depth. The teaching role helps internalize advanced reasoning and terminology over time. The response style outlines best practices for answering queries, though you can customize it to suit your preferences.

## Main Takeaway

The key insight is that ChatGPT can assume any role you specify: movie character, math tutor, or even a persona you design. It’s trained on the entire internet, so its output depends on the model specification, system prompt, context window, available tools and conversation history. Without this context, you cannot judge ChatGPT itself—only a particular “flavour” of it.

## AI Models to Know

* **Claude** by Anthropic – Emphasizes alignment, safety and naturalistic dialogue.
* **Gemini** (formerly Bard) by Google – Integrated with Google search infrastructure.
* **Mistral** – Open‑source models ideal for self‑hosting and experimentation.
* **LLaMA** by Meta – Widely used in research, often embedded into custom workflows.
* **Grok** by xAI – Designed for unfiltered, real‑time interaction.
* **OpenAI** – Known for starting the large‑language‑model revolution.
* **Anthropic** – Popular among engineers.
* **Gemini** – Noted for its long context window.
* **Mistral** – Open source and based in the EU.
* **LLaMA** – Widely used and open source.
* **xAI** – Elon Musk’s entry into the AI race.

## OpenAI ChatGPT Pricing Tiers

1. **Free Plan** – GPT‑4o access; suitable for lightweight tasks.
2. **Plus Plan** – $20 per month; unlocks GPT‑4.5 and o3; ideal for research, writing and coding.
3. **Pro Plan** – $200 per month; includes priority access to new models, faster processing, higher context limits and professional‑grade features.

## OpenAI Model Families

* **GPT‑4o** (“omni”) – Handles text, vision, voice and file input; strong generalist.
* **GPT‑4.5** – Optimized for long‑form reasoning, synthesis and technical writing.
* **o‑series models**:
  * **o3** – Most accurate but slower.
  * **o4‑mini‑high** – Balanced between speed and analytical quality.
  * **o4‑mini** – Fastest, best for low‑latency tasks.
* **Chain‑of‑Thought (CoT)** – Internally reasons step‑by‑step before responding; best for logic‑heavy prompts.

GPT‑5 is expected to dynamically combine these reasoning styles.

## Practical Applications

1. **Learning new topics** – Start with basic questions and refine them to master complex subjects like quantitative finance or philosophy of language.
2. **Brainstorming ideas** – Use GPT to scan, summarize and synthesize academic papers and legal documents.
3. **Writing important documents** – GPT can help sharpen clarity, structure and tone for essays, proposals or other documents.
4. **Learning AI itself** – Improve your system prompts, refine your usual prompts and develop better workflows by asking the model how to leverage itself.
5. **Receiving instant feedback** – Get immediate feedback on writing style, ideas or business plans.
