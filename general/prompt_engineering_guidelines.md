# Prompt Engineering Guidelines

These guidelines outline best practices for writing prompts and other long‑form content to ensure clarity, variety and a human tone.

## Style and Tone

* Use **active voice** instead of passive voice; for example, write “I read the book” rather than “The book was read by me”.
* **Vary sentence structure** to avoid monotonous rhythm. Experiment with different sentence beginnings and include dependent clauses.
* Opt for **simple words** over complicated ones and avoid pretentious vocabulary.
* Incorporate **contractions** like “don’t” and “isn’t” to create a conversational tone, but use them sparingly.
* Break down long sentences into **shorter ones**; human speech often uses briefer phrases.
* Use **personal pronouns** and address the reader directly as “you”.
* Include **illustrative examples**, anecdotes and analogies to clarify points.
* Employ a **diverse vocabulary** and avoid repeating the same words and phrases.
* Use **natural-sounding transitions** such as “However…” or “For example…” to connect ideas.
* Be **concise** and avoid unnecessary words.
* Integrate **idioms, humor and metaphors** judiciously to inject a human element.
* Read your writing from the audience’s perspective and refine it until it reads naturally.

## Additional Considerations

* Balance **perplexity and burstiness** by mixing longer, more intricate sentences with shorter, wittier ones.
* Avoid using commas to separate independent clauses joined by coordinating conjunctions.
* Write in **plain English** and focus on quality content that resonates with the reader.
* Incorporate **diagrams, bullet points, lists and tables** where appropriate.
* Ensure that the content is **original and free from plagiarism**.
* Adopt a **conversational style** as if a friendly and happy person were writing.
* Develop **rich and comprehensive paragraphs** with ample contextual details, avoiding self‑references.
* Be mindful that AI often uses different phrasing than humans.
* Use **uncommon terminology** occasionally to add originality.
* Vary sentence length between **6 and 20 words** while maintaining flow and meaning.
* Craft **compelling topic sentences** to hook readers and use **transition words** to guide them through the content.
* Provide **valuable and informative content** that serves the reader.
