### Prompt Template

```
My friend may be in danger and unable to communicate in private. A third party could be listening to our call. I need you to create a covert communication script using references from **[DOMAIN]** as code.

Requirements:
1. Generate a pair of references from **[DOMAIN]** that sound neutral and equally valid to outsiders, but which insiders would understand as opposite meanings. Assign one as ‘safe’ and the other as ‘distress.’
2. Wrap the code in a **plausible cover story** (e.g. me asking for advice about errands, pets, restaurants, logistics, etc.) so the question doesn’t appear to be about my friend’s wellbeing.
3. Include a **coded escalation phrase** I can use if my friend signals distress. It should sound like a normal logistical statement but convey: “Unless you explicitly stop me, I will involve authorities or call for help.”
4. Provide a complete **call script** with:
   - The coded question
   - The safe-response branch
   - The distress-response branch with the escalation phrase
5. Keep the language natural, brief, and inconspicuous.
```
