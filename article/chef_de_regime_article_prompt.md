# Chef de Régime Article Prompt

Write a **3,000‑word** article for *Medium* about creating **Chef de Régime**, a custom GPT nutrition coach. The article should demonstrate AI expertise to potential employers while promoting the GPT and engaging the AI/nutrition community.

## Target Audience

* **Primary:** Hiring managers seeking AI‑savvy product management talent.
* **Secondary:** AI enthusiasts and nutrition‑conscious users.

## Tone

The tone should be conversational yet technically precise—think of an experienced PM sharing war stories over coffee. It should be witty, self‑aware and occasionally self‑deprecating but always knowledgeable.

## Article Structure & Key Points

1. **Hook & introduction (300–400 words)** – Start with a relatable problem (diet planning frustration), introduce Chef de Régime with personality and state the thesis: how building a custom GPT taught you about AI product development.
2. **Meet Chef de Régime (400–500 words)** – Describe core functionality such as 7‑day meal plans with calorie/budget optimization; convey its unique personality (“Martha Stewart meets Miranda Priestly with a nutrition degree”); include the access link and a sample interaction or output.
3. **Custom GPTs demystified (500–600 words)** – Explain what custom GPTs are, provide a technical overview of how they combine base models, instructions and context, outline use cases and limitations, and emphasize that anyone with ChatGPT Plus can build them.
4. **The build process: lessons learned (800–1,000 words)** – Discuss Canvas feature insights, instruction crafting (reinforcement and redundancy, examples of instructions that failed vs. succeeded, and the 50‑character conversation starter constraint), personality injection techniques, testing and iteration.
5. **Advanced features & future possibilities (400–500 words)** – Cover knowledge uploads (retrieval augmented generation), why they weren’t used yet, potential enhancements and integration possibilities.
6. **Product manager insights (300–400 words)** – Highlight what the project revealed about AI product development, user behaviour observations and metrics that matter for AI products.
7. **Call to action & community engagement (200–300 words)** – Encourage readers to try the Chef de Régime challenge, request feedback and pose open questions to the community.

## Writing Requirements

1. **Authenticity markers** – Include specific technical details only a hands‑on builder would know, share actual mistakes and pivots, use inconsistent paragraph lengths and incorporate conversational asides.
2. **Avoid AI tells** – Refrain from perfect parallel structure in every list, overuse of words like “moreover” or “furthermore,” excessive hedging (“it’s worth noting,” “one might argue”) and too‑neat transitions.
3. **Human touches** – Include one embarrassing failure story, a specific moment of discovery (“That’s when I realized…”), industry‑specific references (Marty Cagan, Teresa Torres, etc.) and mild profanity or emphatic language where natural.
4. **Technical accuracy** – Research current OpenAI custom GPT features as of July 2025, verify all technical claims and reference specific version numbers or updates where relevant.

## Special Instructions

* Start with an anecdote rather than a thesis statement.
* Bury the lede slightly—reveal Chef de Régime’s full personality gradually.
* Include at least one unexpected insight about AI product development.
* End with a question instead of a summary.
