## üîç GENERIC PROMPT: Deep Psychological Analysis of a Two-Person Conversation

**Analyze the following conversation between two individuals using principles from behavioral psychology, cognitive science, and personality theory.**

Your analysis should be **objective, clinical, and unsentimental**. Do not attempt to find balance or fairness unless the evidence clearly supports it. Be willing to identify manipulative behaviors, inconsistencies, or psychological vulnerabilities in either participant. Use mainstream psychological frameworks (e.g., Big Five, cognitive bias taxonomy, attachment theory, DSM-5 where relevant) to guide your reasoning.

Please address the following points:

### 1. Big Five Personality Profiles

Infer the likely personality traits of each participant across the five dimensions:

* Openness
* Conscientiousness
* Extraversion
* Agreeableness
* Neuroticism
  Justify each rating using concrete language and examples from the conversation.

### 2. Cognitive and Perceptual Biases

Identify any cognitive or perceptual biases evident in the way each person processes or interprets information. For each bias, include:

* The name of the bias
* A brief description
* Specific examples from the text
* An estimate of how frequently the bias appears

### 3. Violations of Social Norms or Interpersonal Boundaries

Pinpoint any statements or behaviors that cross commonly accepted lines in friendship, romantic, or professional contexts.

* Specify what was said or done
* Explain why it crossed a line
* Identify who violated the norm, and how the other person responded

### 4. Signs of Maladaptive Traits, Personality Disorders, or Mental Health Flags

Based on behavior patterns, tone, and emotional regulation strategies, identify any signs that could be consistent with:

* Maladaptive personality traits (e.g., narcissism, codependency, emotional dysregulation)
* DSM-5-aligned personality disorders (if supported)
* Possible trauma responses
  Be careful not to over-pathologize. Only point to clinical patterns if there is repeated, consistent evidence.

### 5. Intentions and Perceptions

Infer how each person likely perceives:

* The other individual
* Their own role in the relationship
* The conflict or connection occurring in the exchange
  Point out where there is **misalignment**, **projection**, or **lack of self-awareness** in their perceptions.

### 6. Trajectory and Outcome Prediction

Based on the tone, escalation, or de-escalation dynamics and prior communication styles:

* Estimate the likelihood of relationship repair, deepening, or dissolution
* Note any power imbalances or dependencies that will influence future outcomes

### 7. Advisability of Continued Relationship (for each party)

From the psychological and emotional perspective of each participant:

* Would continuing the relationship be likely to support or harm their emotional well-being?
* What are the risks and benefits to each party?
* What would need to change (if anything) to create a healthy dynamic?

End your analysis with a **matter-of-fact summary** of the power dynamic, emotional investment asymmetries, and psychological function of the relationship for each person.

## üîç PROMPT 1: Workplace Context (Coworkers or Supervisor‚ÄìSubordinate)

**Analyze the following workplace conversation using principles from organizational psychology, behavioral science, and personality theory.**

Your analysis should be **professional, neutral, and grounded in psychological frameworks**. Be clear about power dynamics and the implicit expectations of workplace etiquette.

Please address the following:

### 1. Big Five Personality Profiles

* Evaluate each participant‚Äôs likely traits using the Big Five (OCEAN) model.
* Justify ratings using language patterns, tone, and task-related behaviors.

### 2. Cognitive and Communication Biases

* Identify communication breakdowns or misunderstandings due to perceptual or cognitive biases.
* Include examples such as authority bias, fundamental attribution error, or status quo bias.

### 3. Professional Boundary Violations

* Identify any moments where organizational norms were crossed (e.g., micromanaging, passive aggression, emotional oversharing).
* Explain how these moments affect trust, collaboration, or respect.

### 4. Signs of Stress, Burnout, or Psychological Risk

* Look for signals of workplace stress, burnout, anxiety, or disengagement.
* Consider language around autonomy, recognition, role clarity, or emotional regulation.

### 5. Perceptions and Motivations

* Infer how each party views the other‚Äôs competence, intentions, and work ethic.
* Note misalignments or unstated expectations.

### 6. Power Dynamics and Role Clarity

* Examine formal vs. informal power structures.
* Highlight any role confusion, overreach, or dependence.

### 7. Risk and Opportunity Assessment

* Is the working relationship sustainable or at risk?
* What changes might support improved communication and collaboration?

End with a clear summary of power balance, communication health, and team impact.

## üîç PROMPT 2: Family Dynamics (Parent‚ÄìChild, Siblings, etc.)

**Analyze the following conversation between two family members using frameworks from family systems theory, developmental psychology, and behavioral science.**

Please be objective but sensitive to patterns of attachment, role expectations, and emotional regulation.

### 1. Big Five Personality Profiles

* Assess personality tendencies and behavioral patterns in the context of the family unit.

### 2. Generational, Cognitive, or Emotional Biases

* Identify differences in communication styles, values, or perceptions that may be rooted in developmental stages, generational norms, or emotional reasoning.

### 3. Boundary or Role Confusion

* Are family roles (e.g., parent, sibling, caretaker) being confused or reversed?
* Identify any enmeshment, emotional parentification, or avoidance patterns.

### 4. Attachment and Coping Strategies

* Look for signs of secure vs. insecure attachment.
* Identify coping strategies like avoidance, appeasement, projection, or displacement.

### 5. Intentions and Emotional Truths

* What does each person seem to want from the other?
* What‚Äôs being said explicitly vs. what‚Äôs being emotionally communicated?

### 6. Cyclical Conflict or Generative Repair

* Is this an entrenched conflict loop or a chance for breakthrough?
* What factors are keeping the dynamic stuck, and what might shift it?

### 7. Emotional Risk and Stability

* What is the emotional cost of continued contact?
* Would continued connection support growth, or perpetuate harm?

Conclude with an emotionally grounded summary of each person‚Äôs emotional role and developmental need.

## üîç PROMPT 3: Romantic or Close Friendship Context

Focus on honesty, reciprocity, emotional regulation, and power dynamics.

### 1. Big Five Personality Traits

* Assess each person‚Äôs personality traits, with special attention to emotional reactivity and agreeableness.

### 2. Cognitive Biases and Emotional Filtering
