## The Prompt

I need you to analyze **{COMPANY}**'s current position in the **{INDUSTRY_MARKET}** market and evaluate their prospects for **{STRATEGIC_FOCUS}**. This should be a thorough research piece—think of it as an investment analyst's report.

Start by mapping out the competitive landscape. Who are the major players in {INDUSTRY_MARKET} right now? Include both established giants (like {COMPETITORS}) and emerging challengers. What's the rough market share breakdown?

Then dig into {COMPANY} specifically:
- What's their current market position and estimated revenue?
- Who's their target customer? (demographics, company size, geography, etc.)
- What are their key differentiators—the features, technology, or approach that sets them apart?
- How fast are they growing compared to competitors?
- What do customers say about them? Look for reviews, case studies, or testimonials

Next, assess the market dynamics:
- How big is the total {INDUSTRY_MARKET} market and how fast is it growing?
- What trends are reshaping how customers think about {INDUSTRY_MARKET}?
- Are there any disruptions on the horizon (new technologies, regulatory changes, shifts in customer behavior)?

Finally, give me your assessment: What would it take for {COMPANY} to achieve {STRATEGIC_FOCUS}? What are their biggest obstacles? Their best opportunities? Consider factors like product-market fit, funding position, team strength, and timing.

Structure this as a report with clear sections and support your analysis with specific data points and sources whenever possible. I'm looking for depth here—this should help me make an informed decision about {COMPANY}'s trajectory in the market.
