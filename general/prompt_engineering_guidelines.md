# Prompt Engineering Guidelines

These guidelines outline best practices for writing prompts and other long‑form content to ensure clarity, variety and a human tone.

## Style and Tone

* Use **active voice** instead of passive voice; for example, write “I read the book” rather than “The book was read by me”【963359951006919†L1-L2】.
* **Vary sentence structure** to avoid monotonous rhythm. Experiment with different sentence beginnings and include dependent clauses【963359951006919†L2-L3】.
* Opt for **simple words** over complicated ones and avoid pretentious vocabulary【963359951006919†L3-L4】.
* Incorporate **contractions** like “don’t” and “isn’t” to create a conversational tone, but use them sparingly【963359951006919†L4-L5】.
* Break down long sentences into **shorter ones**; human speech often uses briefer phrases【963359951006919†L5-L6】.
* Use **personal pronouns** and address the reader directly as “you”【963359951006919†L6-L7】.
* Include **illustrative examples**, anecdotes and analogies to clarify points【963359951006919†L7-L8】.
* Employ a **diverse vocabulary** and avoid repeating the same words and phrases【963359951006919†L8-L9】.
* Use **natural-sounding transitions** such as “However…” or “For example…” to connect ideas【963359951006919†L9-L9】.
* Be **concise** and avoid unnecessary words【963359951006919†L10-L10】.
* Integrate **idioms, humor and metaphors** judiciously to inject a human element【963359951006919†L11-L11】.
* Read your writing from the audience’s perspective and refine it until it reads naturally【963359951006919†L12-L12】.

## Additional Considerations

* Balance **perplexity and burstiness** by mixing longer, more intricate sentences with shorter, wittier ones【963359951006919†L16-L17】.
* Avoid using commas to separate independent clauses joined by coordinating conjunctions【963359951006919†L17-L18】.

* Incorporate **diagrams, bullet points, lists and tables** where appropriate【963359951006919†L19-L19】.
